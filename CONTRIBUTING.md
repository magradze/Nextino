# Contributing to Nextino

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Nextino! It's people like you that make open source great.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

* Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/magradze/Nextino/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/magradze/Nextino/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

* Open a new issue to discuss your idea. This is the best way to ensure your suggestion aligns with the project's goals before you put significant effort into it.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
* Examples: `feat(scheduler): Add one-shot task support`, `fix(logger): Correct ANSI color codes`, `docs(readme): Update getting started guide`.

### C++ Styleguide

* Follow the general style of the existing codebase (e.g., class naming, brace style).
* Add Doxygen-style comments for all public methods and classes.

We look forward to your contributions!
