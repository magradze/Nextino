# üí¨ Communication Patterns

In a modular framework like Nextino, a critical question is: "How do modules talk to each other?"

A naive approach would be for one module to directly call a function in another. This creates **tight coupling**, a developer's nightmare. If you change one module, you might break ten others that depend on it.

Nextino solves this by providing a set of standardized **communication patterns** that ensure your modules remain decoupled, independent, and reusable.

## The Golden Rule: No Direct Dependencies

> **Modules must never directly include each other's header files or call each other's methods.**

Instead of direct calls, all communication is mediated through the framework's core services. For `v0.1.0`, the primary communication happens via the `Scheduler`, but the architecture is built to support two powerful patterns for direct inter-module communication in the future.

## Pattern 1: The Event Bus (for Broadcasting) üì¢

* **Status:** `Planned for a future release`
* **Use Case:** When a module needs to announce that something has happened, without knowing (or caring) who is listening. This is a "one-to-many" or "publish-subscribe" pattern.

**Analogy:** Think of it like a radio station. A module (the DJ) broadcasts a message (a song) on a specific channel (the event name, e.g., `"button_pressed"`). Any other module that is "tuned in" to that channel will receive the message. The DJ doesn't need to know who the listeners are.

**Example Scenario:**
A `ButtonModule` detects a press. It posts a `"button_pressed"` event to the `EventBus`. A `LedModule` and a `NetworkModule` are both subscribed to this event. Upon receiving it, the `LedModule` toggles its state, and the `NetworkModule` sends an MQTT message. The `ButtonModule` has no idea that the other two modules even exist.

```mermaid

    participant Button
    participant EventBus
    participant LED
    participant Network

    Button->>+EventBus: post("button_pressed")
    EventBus->>+LED: notify("button_pressed")
    LED-->>-EventBus: (Toggles LED)
    EventBus->>+Network: notify("button_pressed")
    Network-->>-EventBus: (Sends MQTT message)
```

**When to use it:**

* Broadcasting sensor readings.
* Notifying the system of state changes (e.g., "WiFi connected").
* Triggering actions in multiple, unrelated modules from a single source.

## Pattern 2: The Service Locator (for Direct Requests) üìû

* **Status:** `Planned for a future release`
* **Use Case:** When one module needs to request a specific action or piece of data from **another specific module**. This is a "one-to-one" or "request-response" pattern.

**Analogy:** Think of it like a phone book. A module (the caller) needs a specific service (e.g., "the logger"). It asks the `ServiceLocator` (the phone book) for the "logger_service". The `ServiceLocator` provides a direct line (a pointer) to the `Logger` instance, allowing the caller to use its public methods.

**Example Scenario:**
A `SensorModule` needs to log an error. It asks the `ServiceLocator` for the `"logger_service"`. The `ServiceLocator` returns a pointer to the `LoggerModule`. The `SensorModule` can then call `logger->error("Failed to read sensor!")`. The `SensorModule` doesn't need to know how the `LoggerModule` was created or where it is in memory; it only needs to know its registered name.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Sensor
    participant ServiceLocator
    participant Logger

    Sensor->>+ServiceLocator: get<LoggerModule>("logger_service")
    ServiceLocator-->>-Sensor: return logger_instance
    Sensor->>+Logger: logger->error("Failed to read!")
    Logger-->>-Sensor: (Prints error to Serial)
```

**When to use it:**

* When a module needs to control another module directly (e.g., a `WebUIModule` telling a `RelayModule` to turn on).
* When a module needs to fetch data on demand from another module.
* For accessing shared, system-wide services like a logger or a resource manager.

## Summary

| Pattern          | Communication Style | Analogy        | Use For...                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Event Bus**    | One-to-Many (Async) | Radio Station  | Notifications, state changes, broadcasting |
| **Service Locator** | One-to-One (Sync)   | Phone Book     | Direct commands, data requests, services |

By choosing the right pattern for the job, you can build complex applications that remain clean, decoupled, and easy to maintain.
