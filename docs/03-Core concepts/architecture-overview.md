# üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Welcome to the engine room of Nextino! This document provides a high-level overview of the framework's architecture, its core components, and how they work together to create a structured and scalable environment for your embedded applications.

---

## The Layered Architecture

Nextino is designed with a clear separation of concerns, organized into distinct layers. This layered approach is key to achieving platform independence and code reusability.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Your Project
        A[Application Layer]
        A_DESC(Your Modules: <br/> LedModule, SensorModule, etc.)
        A --> A_DESC
    end

    subgraph Nextino Framework
        B[Framework Layer]
        B_DESC(Core Services: <br/> SystemManager, Scheduler, Logger, etc.)
        B --> B_DESC

        C[Hardware Abstraction Layer - HAL]
        C_DESC(Interfaces: <br/> IGpio, II2c, ISerial, etc.)
        C --> C_DESC
    end
    
    subgraph Platform-Specific Code
        D[Platform Layer]
        D_DESC(Concrete Implementations: <br/> ArduinoGpio, Stm32I2c, etc.)
        D --> D_DESC
    end

    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
```

1. **Application Layer:** This is where you live. Your custom modules reside here. They contain the unique business logic of your project (e.g., "if the temperature is above 30¬∞C, turn on the fan"). Modules in this layer only talk to the Framework Layer.

2. **Framework Layer:** This is the core of Nextino. It provides the architectural backbone and essential services like the `SystemManager`, `Scheduler`, and `Logger`. It knows nothing about specific hardware.

3. **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL):** This is the crucial bridge. It defines a set of standard **interfaces** (like `IGpio` or `II2c`) for interacting with hardware. The framework layer uses these interfaces, not the concrete hardware functions.

4. **Platform Layer:** This layer contains the concrete **implementations** of the HAL interfaces for each specific platform (like Arduino, STM32, etc.). For example, `ArduinoGpio` implements the `IGpio` interface by calling `digitalWrite()`.

This separation means your Application Layer code can remain **100% platform-independent**.

## üß© The Core Components

The Framework Layer is built from a set of powerful singleton classes that manage the entire system.

* Note: You will need to create and upload a diagram image for this to work.*

* **SystemManager:** The central "orchestrator". It reads the configuration, creates modules, and manages their lifecycle (`init`, `start`, `loop`).

* **ModuleFactory:** The "builder". It knows how to construct module objects from the configuration data provided by the build script.

* **Scheduler:** The "timekeeper". It manages all non-blocking, time-based tasks, ensuring your `loop()` is fast and your application is responsive.

* **Logger:** The "narrator". It provides a centralized and professional way to output status messages, warnings, and errors.

* **ResourceManager (Future):** The "gatekeeper". It will manage exclusive access to hardware resources like pins to prevent conflicts.

* **EventBus & ServiceLocator (Future):** The "communication network". They will provide structured ways for modules to interact with each other.

## üîÑ The "Plug-and-Play" Data Flow

The "magic" of Nextino's automatic module discovery happens during the build process. Here‚Äôs a simplified view of the data flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant PIO as PlatformIO Build System
    participant Script as bootstrap.py
    participant System as SystemManager (Runtime)

    Dev->>PIO: Runs `pio run`
    PIO->>Script: Executes `extra_scripts`
    Script->>PIO: Scans `lib/` for Nextino modules
    Script->>PIO: Reads all `config.json` files
    Script->>PIO: Generates `include/generated_config.h`
    PIO->>System: Compiles `main.cpp` which includes the generated header
    
    Note over System: At Runtime...
    System->>System: `begin()` is called
    System->>System: Reads `projectConfigJson` from header
    System->>System: Creates modules via ModuleFactory
    System->>System: Calls `init()` and `start()` on all modules
```

This automated process ensures that your `main.cpp` remains clean and decoupled from the specific modules used in the project.

Now that you understand the high-level architecture, let's dive into the details of a module's lifecycle.
