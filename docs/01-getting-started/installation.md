# üì¶ Installation

Integrating the Nextino framework into your project is a straightforward process, thanks to the power of the PlatformIO ecosystem. This guide will walk you through the setup.

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following installed and configured:

1. **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**: The recommended editor for PlatformIO development.
2. **[PlatformIO IDE Extension](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide)**: The core build system and toolchain manager we'll be using.
3. **A Supported Development Board**: Such as an ESP32, ESP8266, or STM32 board.

If you are new to PlatformIO, we highly recommend following their official [ESP32 installation guide](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/platforms/espressif32.html#installation) to get your environment ready.

## üõ†Ô∏è Adding Nextino to Your Project

There are two primary ways to add the Nextino framework to your PlatformIO project: via Git URL (recommended for the latest version) or via the official PlatformIO Registry (once published).

### Method 1: Using the Git URL (Recommended)

This method ensures you are always using the latest version directly from the GitHub repository.

1. **Open Your Project's `platformio.ini` File:**
    This file is the heart of your PlatformIO project's configuration.

2. **Add Nextino to `lib_deps`:**
    Under your specific environment (e.g., `[env:esp32dev]`), add the `lib_deps` option and point it to the Nextino GitHub repository.

    ```ini title="platformio.ini"
    [env:esp32dev]
    platform = espressif32
    board = esp32dev
    framework = arduino
    monitor_speed = 115200
    monitor_filters = colorize

    lib_deps =
        https://github.com/magradze/Nextino.git
    ```

**That's it!** The next time you build your project (`PlatformIO: Build`), PlatformIO will automatically:

* Clone the Nextino repository into your project's `.pio/libdeps` directory.
* Discover the library and make its header files available to your code.
* Execute the framework's internal build scripts.

### Method 2: From the PlatformIO Registry (Future)

Once Nextino is officially published to the PlatformIO Registry, installation will be even simpler. You will be able to specify the library by its owner and name.

```ini title="platformio.ini (Future)"
[env:esp32dev]
; ... other settings
lib_deps =
    magradze/Nextino
```

This method is ideal for pinning your project to a specific, stable version of the framework.

## üìÇ Project Structure Overview

After adding Nextino, a typical project structure will look like this:

```
MyNextinoProject/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ include/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ generated_config.h  // Auto-generated by Nextino's build script
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MyCustomModule/       // Your own project-specific modules
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.cpp              // Your main application file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ platformio.ini            // Your project configuration
```

The Nextino framework itself will be installed inside the hidden `.pio` directory, keeping your project's root clean.

### Next Steps

Now that you have the framework installed, it's time to build your first application!
