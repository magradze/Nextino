## [0.1.0] - 2025-08-19 - The "Birthday" Release

This is the very first public release of the Nextino Framework. It establishes the foundational architecture and introduces the core concepts of modular, configuration-driven development for the Arduino ecosystem.

This initial release is dedicated to my son on his birthday. May your curiosity and creativity build amazing things, just as we hope developers will with this framework.

### ‚ú® Added

* **Core Framework (`v0.1.0`):**
  * `SystemManager`: Central orchestrator for module lifecycle management.
  * `BaseModule`: The abstract contract for all modules.
  * `Scheduler`: A non-blocking, `millis()`-based task scheduler.
  * `Logger`: A professional, leveled, and colored logging system.
  * `ModuleFactory`: A factory for dynamically creating modules from configuration.
* **Build System:**
  * Introduced an advanced Python build script (`bootstrap.py`) for automatic module discovery and configuration generation.
* **Example Project:**
  * Added the `01_PlugAndPlay_Blink` example to demonstrate the core "Plug-and-Play" philosophy.
* **Documentation:**
  * Created initial project documentation including `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `MANIFESTO.md`, and `TESTING.md`.

### üß™ Tests

* Set up the testing infrastructure with PlatformIO and Unity.
* Added initial unit tests for the `Scheduler` component.
